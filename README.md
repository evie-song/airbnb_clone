# Airbnb Clone

This is a practice project clone of Airbnb's website. It is not a complete clone, but it copies most of the core functionality of the real Airbnb and its visuals. It uses Ruby on Rails on the backend and has JS logic built with jQuery.

To try this project out locally, clone the repo and check out the `with_storage` branch. That branch has the local storage files and sqlite DB checked in so that you can click around the app with some example data and images pre-populated.

- `bundle install` to install dependencies
  - you might need to install ruby 3.1.2 if you don't already have it. to do this with `asdf`:
    - `asdf plugin add ruby`
    - `adsf ruby install 3.1.2`
    - `asdf local ruby 3.1.2`

- `rails s` to start the server

- navigate to `localhost:3000` to try it out!
